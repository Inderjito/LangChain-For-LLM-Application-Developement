# LangChain-For-LLM-Application-Developement
## Here’s a quick breakdown of what I covered:
- Direct API Calls to OpenAI: Efficiently integrating LLMs through API calls, allowing for more customizable model interactions, perfect for tailoring AI to specific needs.
## LangChain Core Components:
Prompts, Models, and Output Parsers: Really delved into structuring effective prompts and making sure the output is parsed in ways that align with business objectives.

## Memory
ConversationalBuffer Memory
ConversationBufferWindowMemory
ConversationTokenBufferMemory 
ConversationSummaryMemory 


## Chains
 Explored how LLMChain, SequentialChain, and Router Chain create more modular and scalable AI workflows.

•	Sequential Chains
	SimpleSequentialChain
	SequentialChain
•	Router Chain

## Q&A Over Documents
 One of the coolest parts was learning how to query documents efficiently think of searching a product catalog for specific items or retrieving key insights from large reports.


## Evaluation Techniques:
From manual debugging to LLM-assisted evaluation, I’ve picked up some great techniques for refining model performance and making AI systems more reliable.
LangChain: Evaluation
Outline:
•	Example generation
•	Manual evaluation (and debuging)
•	LLM-assisted evaluation
•	LangChain evaluation platform

## LangChain Agents: I also got hands-on experience with built-in tools like DuckDuckGo search and Wikipedia, and even learned how to define custom tools—key for creating more specialized AI solutions

**Overall, this course has added a lot of depth to my understanding of LangChain and its potential to drive impactful AI applications, particularly in areas like financial services and data-driven decision-making![image](https://github.com/user**
